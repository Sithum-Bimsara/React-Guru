    "# Understanding the `this` Keyword in JavaScript 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction 📌\n",
    "The `this` keyword in JavaScript is one of the most confusing concepts for developers, especially for those coming from languages like C# or Java. Unlike those languages, where `this` always refers to the current object, JavaScript behaves differently depending on how a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: The `walk` Method 👣\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a `person` object with a `walk` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const person = {\n",
    "    walk() {\n",
    "        console.log(this);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we call `person.walk()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "person.walk();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output 📤\n",
    "We see our `person` object logged in the console. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Because when a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happens When We Assign `walk` to a Constant? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a constant and assign it the `walk` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const walk = person.walk;\n",
    "console.log(walk);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output 📤\n",
    "It logs the function definition to the console. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's call the `walk` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "walk();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unexpected Output ❌\n",
    "Instead of logging the `person` object, we get `undefined`. 😲\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does `this` Become `undefined`? 🤯\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 The value of `this` is determined by **how** a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 When a function is called as an **object method**, `this` refers to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 When a function is called **standalone (outside an object(`person`))**, `this` refers to the **global object** (i.e., `window` in browsers).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 However, in this React project, `strict mode` is enabled by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Strict Mode? 🔒\n",
    "Strict mode enforces better coding practices by preventing the accidental use of the global object. In strict mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of referencing `window`, `this` is set to `undefined` when calling a function standalone.\n",
    "- This helps avoid unintended errors and makes JavaScript code safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways 📝\n",
    "✅ `this` inside an **object method** → Refers to the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ `this` inside a **standalone function** → Refers to `window` (unless in strict mode, where it is `undefined`).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ `strict mode` prevents accidental access to `window`, making JavaScript safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion 🎯\n",
    "Understanding `this` in JavaScript is crucial for writing effective code. Always remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **How** you call a function determines `this`.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 In **strict mode**, `this` is `undefined` for standalone functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠️ Use `.bind()`, `call()`, or `apply()` to explicitly set `this` when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🎉\n"
